Hi 👋 I’m **Jonatan Salas** — Product Engineer from Argentina.

I build software products from idea to production: shaping architecture, writing code, designing systems, and setting up the infrastructure that allows teams to ship reliably.

I’m the founder of [**BlackBox Vision**](https://github.com/blackboxvision), where we focus on turning complex product requirements into scalable, maintainable software.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Product architecture & system design
- Frontend platforms at scale (React, React Native, micro-frontends)
- Mobile engineering (Android & iOS)
- Cloud-native infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Developer experience, tooling, and reusable libraries

I care about how software is built in the context of real products, real constraints, and real teams.

I write about engineering lessons learned while building products:

Most repositories here are things I built to solve real problems while shipping.

💬 Ask me about product architecture, React, React Native, mobile, micro-frontends, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD.
