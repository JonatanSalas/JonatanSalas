# Hi 👋 I’m Jonatan Salas — Product Engineer

I build **scalable digital products** from idea to production — shaping architecture, writing code, designing systems, and setting up the infrastructure that allows teams to ship reliably.

I’m the founder of [**BlackBox Vision**](https://github.com/blackboxvision), where we help companies turn complex product requirements into maintainable, high-impact software.

## What I Work On

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Product architecture & system design  
- Frontend platforms at scale (React, React Native, micro-frontends)  
- AI engineering, data pipelines & ETL  
- Mobile engineering (Android & iOS)  
- Cloud-native infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)  
- Developer experience, tooling & reusable libraries  

I care deeply about how software is built in the context of **real products, real constraints, and real teams**.

## How I Think

I don’t approach problems as isolated technical tasks.  
I approach them as **product challenges** that require clarity, system thinking, and disciplined engineering.

Most repositories here come from solving real problems while shipping real products.

## Ask Me About
